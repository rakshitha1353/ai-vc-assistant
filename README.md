AI-Powered VC Due Diligence Assistant ðŸ¤–
Project Overview
The AI-Powered VC Due Diligence Assistant is a cutting-edge tool designed to help venture capital analysts, angel investors, and startup founders quickly and comprehensively analyze a company's pitch deck or deal note.

By leveraging Google's Gemini AI, the application goes beyond a simple summary, providing a deep-dive analysis, identifying key risks and opportunities, and even simulating a live pitch meeting. This project streamlines the initial screening process, allowing for faster and more informed investment decisions.

Key Features âœ¨
Core Analysis: Instantly generates a concise, investor-ready deal note covering financials, market opportunity, team, and technology.

Proactive Alerts: Provides a high-level summary of "ðŸŸ¢ Green Lights" (Strengths) and "ðŸ”´ Red Flags" (Risks) immediately after file upload.

Interactive Pitch Meeting Simulation: This is the unique feature. The AI adopts the persona of a startup founder, allowing investors to "Q&A" the pitch deck directly. This simulates a live meeting and helps in vetting the founder's narrative.

What-If Scenario Analysis: A powerful tool to model how changes in key metrics (e.g., increased burn rate or funding ask) would impact the investment case and runway.

Comprehensive Financial and Market Analysis: Conducts a detailed breakdown of the company's financial health, competitive landscape, and overall market position.

PDF and Text Support: Supports analysis of both .pdf and .txt files for maximum flexibility.
